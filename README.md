# torboxhole

Automatic downloader for .nbz files using the Torbox API.<br>
Useful while using Usenet Blackholes in Radarr or Sonarr.

## Restrictions
This application currently runs on a single thread meaning parallel downloads are not supported. Right now this is not a big priority for me, as I only want to download one file at a time. Feel free to contribute :)
